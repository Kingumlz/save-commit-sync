Also, I don't _really_ know how to use github workflows or actions or whatever they're called, so don't trust the little icons above. It's residual from the original repository. Don't judge me!

## Tutorial

To run the main command (Upload to Cloud) which saves all, commits and syncs to github use either the the button on the top of the screen or the keybinding (ctrl and shift and s).
There really isn't much else you need to know. That's it.

There is documentation in the /docs folder for the original repo.
