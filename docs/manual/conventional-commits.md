# Conventional Commits

Info on how the Conventional Commits standard is applied for generating output in this project.


## Resources

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) homepage


## Overview

Here is the full syntax for a commit message:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

The standard says that description is meant to start with a _lowercase letter_, so this is applied throughout this project.

This Auto Commit Extension project focuses only on the first part:

```
<TYPE>(SCOPE): DESCRIPTION
```

Perhaps one day some details will be added to the body.
