# Conventional Commits

Info on how the Conventional Commits standard is applied for generating output in this project.


## Resources

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) homepage
- [Conventionl Commits](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/other/conventional-commits.html) cheatsheets in my Dev Cheatsheets projects.


## Overview

Here is the full syntax for a commit message:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

The standard says that description is meant to start with a _lowercase letter_, so this is applied throughout this project.

This Auto Commit Extension project focuses only on the first part:

```
TYPE: DESCRIPTION
```

Or

```
TYPE(SCOPE): DESCRIPTION
```

Perhaps one day some details will be added to the body.
