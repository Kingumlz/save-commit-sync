> How to get the pre-built extension installed in VS Code

_This extension is not yet available through the VS Code extension marketplace._

This guides covers how to get the extension installed globally in your VS Code using a downloaded file and then start using the extension.


## How to use

### Install

Install the extension from a recent release on GitHub - see [Installation](/docs/manual/installation.md).

### Run

Then use it like this:

1. Open VS Code where you have a Git repo.
2. In the Git pane, click the extension's button.
3. Edit a single file. Or stage one file if you have many changes.
4. If possible, the extension will create a descriptive commit message for you in the commit message box.


## Requirements

To install the extension, you only need:

- VS Code installed
- The ability to run terminal commands.
-
You do **not** need to download the repo or have Node or NPM installed.
