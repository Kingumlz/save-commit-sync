# Quickstart

## Install

Install the extension from the Marketplace - see [Installation](/docs/manual/installation.md).


## Run

Then use it like this:

1. Open VS Code where you have a Git repo.
1. Edit one or more files.
1. Optionally stage one files.
    - This is useful if want smaller changes in your commit and your commit message.
    - Staging is necessary if you do a _move_ or _rename_, so that Git sees the old and new path as the _same_ file.
1. In VS Code's built-in Git pane, click the extension's icon.
1. The extension will create a descriptive commit message for you in the commit message box.
1. Optionally edit the message.
1. Commit - click the tick button.
