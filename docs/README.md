# Auto Commit Message documentation

This project aims to prepare a smart commit message for you to make your development smoother.


## Overview

- User manual
    - See the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) page - you can download and install a pre-built extension. No need to work with this repo directly or be familiar with JavaScript.
- Developer guides


<!--

The docs are split into two features:

- [Extension](extension.md)
- [Terminal hook](terminal-hook.md)

Part ideas:

- A shell script in a repo
- References a concatenated JS script from this repo (just the text handling and not the full extension), which is in a bin directory.
