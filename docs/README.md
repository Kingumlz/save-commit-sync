# Auto Commit Message documentation ⚙️ 🧙‍♂️ ✉️

This project serves to prepare a smart commit message for you, to make your development flow smoother.


## Overview

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
- [About](about.md)
- [Features](features.md)
    - What it can do, upcoming features, and how it works
- [User manual](manual/)
    - How to install and use the installed extension.
- [Development](development/)
    - Guide for developers to set up and run locally.
    - Useful for testing your changes before contributing a PR.

<!--

The docs are split into two features:

- [Extension](extension.md)
- [Terminal hook](terminal-hook.md)

Part ideas:

- A shell script in a repo
- References a concatenated JS script from this repo (just the text handling and not the full extension), which is in a bin directory.
