# Documentation - Auto Commit Message

This project aims to prepare a smart commit message for your when you enter `git commit`, which you can use or ignore.

The docs are split into two features:

- [Terminal hook](terminal-hook.md)
- [Extension](extension.md)

<!--

Part ideas:

- A shell script in a repo
- References a concatenated JS script from this repo (just the text handling and not the full extension), which is in a bin directory.

-->
