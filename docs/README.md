# Documentation - Auto Commit Message

This project aims to prepare a smart commit message for you to make your development smoother.


## Overview

- Install a pre-built extension
    - See [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
- For developers
    - Start with [installation](installation.md) to install.
    - Continue to [development](development.md) doc for local development. 
    - See the [package](package.md) doc to roll your own copy and install it, using single command.


<!--

The docs are split into two features:

- [Extension](extension.md)
- [Terminal hook](terminal-hook.md)

Part ideas:

- A shell script in a repo
- References a concatenated JS script from this repo (just the text handling and not the full extension), which is in a bin directory.
