# Documentation - Auto Commit Message

This project aims to prepare a smart commit message for you to make your development smoother.


## Overview

 Install a pre-built extension
    - See [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
- For developers
    - Start with the [Installation](installation.md) doc to install it.
    - Continue to [Development](development.md) doc for local development.
    - See the [Export](export.md) doc to roll your own copy and install it, using a single command.
    - The [Deploy](deploy.md) covers the deploy pipeline and releases.

<!--

The docs are split into two features:

- [Extension](extension.md)
- [Terminal hook](terminal-hook.md)

Part ideas:

- A shell script in a repo
- References a concatenated JS script from this repo (just the text handling and not the full extension), which is in a bin directory.
